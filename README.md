# XOR File Encryption
This is a simple tool written in C that uses `XOR` logic to encode given files.

### Usage:

`make`

`encrypt [file] [password]`

#### Every argument must be passed for the app to work.

It's one of my simple works, it's not very complicated tho. :))

I'd maybe challenge you to write decrypt program for it :P
