# Simple XOR File Encryptor
This is a simple tool written in C that uses `XOR` logic to encode given files.

Usage:
```gcc main.c

./a.out [to encode file] [encoded file] [password]```

Every argument must be passed for the app to work.
It's one of my simple works, it's not very complicated tho. :))
