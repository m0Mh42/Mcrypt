# Simple XOR File Encryptor
This is a simple tool written in C that uses `XOR` logic to encode given files.

Usage:

`gcc main.c`

`a.out [file1] [file2] [password]`

Every argument must be passed for the app to work.

It works in both ways of encrypting and decrypting. Pass any file to the app for it to XOR it's contents with the password to encrypt or decrypt.

It's one of my simple works, it's not very complicated tho. :))
